  # Groundwater Root Interaction Flag, Specify as 0, 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5 (default is 5)
   #     This determines if there is groundwater uptake to meet crop demand and 
   #     if the Potential Consumptive Use is reduced due to anoxia and soil stresses
   # 
   # 0 = No Transpiration            ==> Zeros out any T requirement
   # 1 = No Groundwater Interaction  ==> No Root-Groundwater Uptake, No  Anoxia or Stress Reduction, Full CU must be met through surface sources (Precip or Irrigation)
   # 2 = Has Anoxia/Soil Stress Loss,                      NO Root-Groundwater Uptake ==> CU Reduced from any anoxia and soil stress, but CU may only be satisfied with surface sources
   # 3 = Has Root-Groundwater Uptake,                      NO Anoxia/Soil Stress Loss ==> Anoxia and Soil Stress losses are either added to Root-Groundwater Uptake or surface consumption requirement  (i.e. if there is root-groundwater uptake, then the amount lost through anoxia is consumed as root-groundwater uptake. However if there is no root-groundwater uptake then the anoxia is added to the surface sources consumption (Precip or Irrigation) 
   # 4 = Has Root-Groundwater Uptake and Soil Stress Loss, NO Anoxia Loss             ==> Anoxia                 losses are either added to Root-Groundwater Uptake or surface consumption requirement  (i.e. if there is root-groundwater uptake, then the amount lost through anoxia is consumed as root-groundwater uptake. However if there is no root-groundwater uptake then the anoxia is added to the surface sources consumption (Precip or Irrigation) 
   # 5 = Full Interaction  ==> HAS Anoxia/Soil Stress Reduction, HAS Root-Groundwater Uptake  (DEFAULT)
